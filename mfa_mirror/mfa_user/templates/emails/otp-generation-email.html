    Dear user,
</p>

<p>
    Here are your new passcodes. Please do not expose them to other people.
</p>


<h2>
    Detailed Instructions
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Click on 'Enter a Passcode' button in the login screen.</li>
    <li>Input an unused passcode from the list, starting at the top.</li>
    <li>You cannot re-use passcodes.</li>
    <li>Any passcodes above the one you use become expired.</li>
    <li>Any passcodes created before the one you use become expired.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Passcodes</h2>
<ol>
{% for otp in otp_list %}
    <li><em>{{ otp }}</em></li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>

<h2>Security Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Generating one passcode at a time is more secure than generating a lot at once.</li>
    <li>If you accidentally expose the passcodes to other people, use the last passcode on the list. This will expire all the other passcodes.</li>
    <li>You can delete your MFA Mirror account <a href="#">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Best,
    <br>
    MFA Mirror Team
